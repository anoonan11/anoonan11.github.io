              I am incredibly passionate about backpacking. In one perspective, my passion for it explains a lot about who I am as a person. When you're backpacking, you're in so much control of what you do, where you go, what you eat, when you eat, etc.
              You manage your schedule, time, and who you spend it with. If a particular campsite doesn't suit you, you pack up and move on. When you're curious about a side trail, you decide whether or not you take it and how far you venture down that road. 
            </p>

              For me, this is exactly how I've viewed my professional life. When I was in high school, I loved chemistry, biology, math, and computer science. While I wasn't particularly the best at all of these subjects, I knew that I wanted to spend as much
              of my life dedicated to these subjects as I could. Hence, I decided to major in Chemical and Biomedical Engineering, the perfect fit.

              I loved my majors, Chemical and Biomedical Engineering. For me, it checked all of the boxes-- complex math, applied chemistry and biology, fascinating research opportunities and down-to-Earth people who were just as passionate as I was. In fact, I was so passionate about these subjects
              that I almost considered pursuing a PhD in them, especially after spending two summers delving into biodefense research with incredibly smart and passionate people. 
            </p>
            <p>
              However, I wasn't sure of which facet of the industry inspired me so much that I could spend 5 years of my life dedicated to it. So I decided I'd try out an industry job before graduating and work in industry
              to really uncover what I wanted to do after college.

              I interned for Procter & Gamble in Product Design and while I was there, I was exposed to a type of field that I was incredibly fascinated by-- molecular interaction modelling. All the research of product interactions I had done that summer was blown out of 
              the window by a simple simulated experiment. My passion for technology and simulation was officially started. 
            </p>
            <p>
              But I wasn't sure how to get there and if I was sure how to know it was time to make that choice for my career.

              To truly sample different industries, functions, and roles while gaining exposure to technology and elite training in this regard, I decided to go into consulting.

              While at Deloitte, I worked in many different industries: MedTech, pharmaceuticals, oil and gas, and financial services. I learned SQL and VBA and made my own tools to enhance my analytical tools and models for strategy and operations projects. But, I wanted to delve deeper into technology and knew I wanted to build more robust tools from scratch. That's when I heard of the Capital One Developer Academy (CODA) Program at Capital One.

              CODA and Capital One have been incredible experiences for me. Capital One gave me the opportunity to not only learn how to become an incredibly proficient fullstack developer but also launched my career in software engineering. They supported me through my journey studying and passing the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Solutions Architect Associate exam and also paid for part of my Masters degree at Georgia Tech.

              Speaking of which, since August 2021, I've been working full-time at Capital One and studying part-time at the Georgie Institute of Technology where I am working towards my Masters in Computer Science with a concentration in Interactive Intelligence. While it's sometimes difficult to work, study, and enjoy other parts of life, I am incredibly thankful to formerly advance my education in my industry.
