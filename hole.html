        <p class="content-text">While at Capital One, I participated in the Capital One Developer Academy. As our Unit 3 project, we were required to self-study topic and work on teams of four to apply that topic to a free-form project. In this project, my team members individually studied TensorFlow and applying its machine learning libraries.</p>
        <p class="content-text">Over the course of a week, our team used TensorFlow's Posenet library to create a game that replicates the Japanese game show, "Hole in the Wall." In our game, the user is shown a pose to replicate as well as their video image. They are given 5 seconds to get into that position, and the Posenet library determines whether the position is a match or not by analyzing the user's webcam input against the position shown.</p>
        <p class="content-text">The game has two player and single player mode and allows the user to take breaks during the game. After three rounds, if the user either has the most number of matches compared to their opponent or at least two out of three matches in single player mode, they win the game. At the end of the game, the user is shown snapshots of their poses that the camera detected as well as a skeleton overlay of what Posenet determined their pose to be so they can improve their technique in the future.</p>
        <p class="content-text">This game was developed at Capital One with their resources so the source code and gameplay demo is private.</p>
