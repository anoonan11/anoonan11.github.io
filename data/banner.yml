  I am a software engineer, backpacker, runner, weightlifter, and cyclist.

  My passions are modeling and analyzing processes and data. Specifically, I love using computer science to study and model all sorts of data, whether it be financial, chemical, biological, or health data. I am also a huge advocate for ethical computing and seek to learn more each day on how we can use software engineering to create more equitable outcomes for all people.
