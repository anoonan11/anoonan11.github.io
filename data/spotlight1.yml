  I work at Capital One in Card Tech, where I am on a team that is created a posted transactions data pipeline using managed EMR and Spark and am currently developing cloud-native REST APIs in Golang as an abstraction to the financial core of the business. Predominantly, I work on the backend of applications and cloud infrastructure (AWS).
