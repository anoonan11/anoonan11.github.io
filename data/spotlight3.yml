title : "Chemical & Biomedical Engineer"
content: |
  As an undergraduate, I majored in Chemical Engineering and had an additional major in Biomedical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. While at Carnegie Mellon, I conducted research under Dr. Schneider where our group researched methods to separate DNA that is 10-100x faster than commercial methods. This work can be applied to forensic and genomic analysis and recovery of trace miRNA biomarkers for cancer diagnostics. By delving into this research and taking courses such as Surgery for Engineers and Medical Devices, I deeped my passion for health equity and biomedical research.
