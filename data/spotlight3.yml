  As an undergraduate, I double majored in Chemical and Biomedical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. While at Carnegie Mellon, I conducted research under Dr. Schneider where our group researched methods that would excelerate forensic and genomic analysis and recovery of biomarkers for cancer diagnostics. By delving into this research and taking courses such as Surgery for Engineers and Medical Devices, I deepened my passion for health equity and biomedical research.
