  As an undergraduate, I majored in Chemical Engineering and had an additional major in Biomedical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. While at Carnegie Mellon, I conducted research under Dr. Schneider where our group researched methods to separate DNA that is 10-100x faster than commercial methods. This work can be applied to forensic and genomic analysis and recovery of trace miRNA biomarkers for cancer diagnostics.
