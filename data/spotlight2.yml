  I am currently pursuing my Masters of Science in Computer Science from the Georgia Institute of Technology where my concentration is in Human Computer Interaction. While pursuing this degree part-time, I've had the opportunity to deepen my passions for ethical computing, the political impact of technology, and health informatics.
