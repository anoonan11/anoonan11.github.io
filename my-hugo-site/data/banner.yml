  I am a software engineer, backpacker, runner, weightlifter, and cyclist.

  My passions are modeling and analyzing complicated processes and phenomena, such as taking something super complex like chemistry, biology, or health data and using computer science to study and model these complexities. I am also a huge advocate for ethical computing and seek to learn more each day on how we can use software engineering to create more equitable outcomes for all people.
